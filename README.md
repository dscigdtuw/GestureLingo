# A Sign Language Recognition System for Speech-Impaired People

## Aim
The aim behind this work is to develop a system for recognizing the sign language, which provides communication between people with speech impairment and normal people, thereby reducing the communication gap between them.

## Objective
The main objective is to translate sign language to text/speech. It provides a helping-hand for speech-impaired to communicate with the rest of the world using sign language. This leads to the elimination of the middle person who generally acts as a medium of translation. This would contain a user-friendly environment for the user by providing speech/text output for a sign gesture input.

## Problem definition
The only mode of interaction for deaf-mute people is sign language. The problem is not confined only to a deaf-mute person who is unable to hear or speak, but another problem is lack of awareness of deaf culture by normal people. Majority of hearing people have either no/little knowledge or experience of sign language . There are also more than 300 sign languages and it is hard for a normal person to understand and become used to these languages. Hence it creates a communication barrier between the disabled and society.
